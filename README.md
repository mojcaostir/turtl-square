Let's say you have an empty web page open in your web browser. 

The width and height of your web browser window can vary. 

Calculate the biggest square you can fit on the page (position, edge length). 

Then calculate the next biggest square you can fit without overlapping any other squares
that are already on the page. 

Keep doing this until there is no room left on the page
and you have calculated all the squares you can fit on it.
